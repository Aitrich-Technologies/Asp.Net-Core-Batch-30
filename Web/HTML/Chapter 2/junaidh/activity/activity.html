    <h1 id="section 1">About Us</h1>
    <p>FotMob is a leading mobile application that has revolutionized how football (soccer) fans follow the sport. Launched in 2004 by brothers Christer and Tommy Nordvik in Norway, it originated from their personal frustration with the lack of reliable and comprehensive ways to track matches from afar. Since then, it has grown into an indispensable tool for over 20 million users globally, offering real-time live scores, lightning-fast goal notifications, and extensive statistics for more than 400 competitions worldwide. Users can customize alerts for their favorite teams and players, access in-depth match data including Expected Goals (xG) and shot maps, and even view official match highlights or listen to audio commentary. FotMob's success is attributed to its vast data coverage, user-friendly interface, and commitment to delivering timely and accurate information, effectively "changing the way the world follows football."</p>
