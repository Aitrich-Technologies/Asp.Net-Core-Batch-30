    <p>Harper Lee’s classic novel To Kill a Mockingbird is a powerful exploration of racial injustice, moral growth, and compassion
         set in the American South during the 1930s. Through the innocent eyes of Scout Finch, the story unfolds around her father,
          Atticus Finch, a lawyer who bravely defends a Black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee masterfully portrays 
          the complexities of human nature and social prejudice, emphasizing empathy and integrity. One of Atticus’s most memorable lines
           captures the novel’s central message:<blockquote><cite>You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view…
         until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.</cite></blockquote> This timeless quote urges readers to practice empathy and see beyond their
          own narrow perspectives.</p>

          <h4><pre>The gentle rhythm of rain tapping against the window creates a soothing melody, wrapping the world in a calm, gray blanket.
                  As drops race each other down the glass, trees sway lightly, their leaves shimmering with tiny beads of water.
              Inside,
              a warm cup of tea steams on the table, offering comfort against the cool air. 
                   It’s a simple, quiet moment that reminds us how peaceful life can be
                         when we pause to notice the small, beautiful details around us.</pre></h4>
